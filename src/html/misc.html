<h2>HTTP Methods</h2>
<div>
	<h3>Idempotent</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>... aside from error or expiration issues ... the side-effects of N &gt; 0 identical
		   requests is the same as for a single request ... The methods GET, HEAD,
		   PUT and DELETE share this property. Also, the methods OPTIONS and
		   TRACE ...
		</p>
		<footer><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.6" target="_blank">RFC 2616 HTTP/1.1</a>, section 9.1.2</footer>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		This means that the side effect of a request is identical whether 1 such request is sent or
		a million! A side effect might be changing a value in a database or uploading a file, for
		example.
	</p>
	<p>
		On thing to notice in the above definition is that POST is <em>not</em> necessarily
		idempotent! I.e., two identical POST requests may have different side effects than a single
		such request. You'll see why in the section on this method.
	</p>

	<h3>GET</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			... retrieve whatever information ... is identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers
			to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned ...
		</p>
		<footer><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.6" target="_blank">RFC 2616 HTTP/1.1</a>, section 9.3</footer>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		GET is idempotent because the request can be made any number of times but the content
		on the server will not change. I.e. the side effect is the same whether 1 or many requests
		are sent (there are no side effects).
	</p>

	<h3>POST</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			... requests that the origin server accept the
			entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource
			identified by the Request-URI...
		</p>
		<footer><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.6" target="_blank">RFC 2616 HTTP/1.1</a>, section 9.5</footer>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		&quot;Subordinate&quot; just indicates an &quot;is contained/owned/part-of&quot;
		relationship. E.g. a file is subordinate to a directory.
	</p>
	<p>
		&quot;Accept[ing] the enitity ... as a new subordinate&quot; implies that whatever
		is POSTed is always added as new, which could, for example, be an append operation.
		Therefore, two such requests will not have the same side effect as one such event. In
		the former two objects could be added to, say, a list, and in the latter only one.
		Therefore <b>POST need not be idempotent</b>. In fact, one of the RFC examples is
		&quot;extending a database through an append operation&quot;.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			... The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the
			server and is usually dependent on the Request-URI ...
		</p>
		<footer><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.6" target="_blank">RFC 2616 HTTP/1.1</a>, section 9.5</footer>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		In the POST request, and this is the reason for the non-idempotency, the URI
		identifies the <em>resource that will process/handle</em> the message contents. Because the
		processing is whatever the server likes, POSTs cannot guarantee idempotency, because the
		server can do whatever it likes with the message contents... all that was specified was the
		resource that operates on the contents!
	</p>

	<h3>PUT</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>...The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the
		   supplied Request-URI ..</p>
		<footer><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.6" target="_blank">RFC 2616 HTTP/1.1</a>, section 9.6</footer>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		In a PUT request, the URI identifies the <em>entity in the request</em>, i.e., the message
		contents. This is why idempotency is required. If we PUT the same uniquely identified thing
		many times, we should still have one uniquely identified thing!
	</p>

	<h3>DELETE</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>... requests that the origin server delete the resource
   identified by the Request-URI ...</p>
		<footer><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.6" target="_blank">RFC 2616 HTTP/1.1</a>, section 9.7</footer>

		<h2>Root Sumsung S3 Mini</h2>
		<p>
			Had some problems getting 
			<a href="http://www.kingoapp.com/" 
				target="_blank">Kingo Root</a> to connect to my phone. It seemed
			the driver installation would constantly fail. I tried various drivers
			but the one that worked for me was found 
			<a href="http://androidxda.com/download-samsung-usb-drivers"
				target="_blank">here at Android XDA</a>. The driver for
			&quot;Samsung Galaxy S3 <b>(all variants)</b>&quot; was the one that worked.
			For some reason the one for &quot;Samsung Galaxy S3&quot; did not!
		</p>
		<p>
			Having installed that driver Kingo Root worked as it promised :)
