<h2>HTTP Methods</h2>
<div>
	<h3>Idempotent</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>... aside from error or expiration issues ... the side-effects of N &gt; 0 identical
		   requests is the same as for a single request ... The methods GET, HEAD,
		   PUT and DELETE share this property. Also, the methods OPTIONS and
		   TRACE ...
		</p>
		<footer><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.6" target="_blank">RFC 2616 HTTP/1.1</a>, section 9.1.2</footer>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		This means that the side effect of a request is identical whether 1 such request is sent or
		a million! A side effect might be changing a value in a database or uploading a file, for
		example.
	</p>
	<p>
		On thing to notice in the above definition is that POST is <em>not</em> necessarily
		idempotent! I.e., two identical POST requests may have different side effects than a single
		such request. You'll see why in the section on this method.
	</p>

	<h3>GET</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			... retrieve whatever information ... is identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers
			to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned ...
		</p>
		<footer><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.6" target="_blank">RFC 2616 HTTP/1.1</a>, section 9.3</footer>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		GET is idempotent because the request can be made any number of times but the content
		on the server will not change. I.e. the side effect is the same whether 1 or many requests
		are sent (there are no side effects).
	</p>

	<h3>POST</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			... requests that the origin server accept the
			entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource
			identified by the Request-URI...
		</p>
		<footer><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.6" target="_blank">RFC 2616 HTTP/1.1</a>, section 9.5</footer>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		&quot;Subordinate&quot; just indicates an &quot;is contained/owned/part-of&quot;
		relationship. E.g. a file is subordinate to a directory.
	</p>
	<p>
		&quot;Accept[ing] the enitity ... as a new subordinate&quot; implies that whatever
		is POSTed is always added as new, which could, for example, be an append operation.
		Therefore, two such requests will not have the same side effect as one such event. In
		the former two objects could be added to, say, a list, and in the latter only one.
		Therefore <b>POST need not be idempotent</b>. In fact, one of the RFC examples is
		&quot;extending a database through an append operation&quot;.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			... The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the
			server and is usually dependent on the Request-URI ...
		</p>
		<footer><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.6" target="_blank">RFC 2616 HTTP/1.1</a>, section 9.5</footer>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		In the POST request, and this is the reason for the non-idempotency, the URI
		identifies the <em>resource that will process/handle</em> the message contents. Because the
		processing is whatever the server likes, POSTs cannot guarantee idempotency, because the
		server can do whatever it likes with the message contents... all that was specified was the
		resource that operates on the contents!
	</p>

	<h3>PUT</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>...The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the
		   supplied Request-URI ..</p>
		<footer><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.6" target="_blank">RFC 2616 HTTP/1.1</a>, section 9.6</footer>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		In a PUT request, the URI identifies the <em>entity in the request</em>, i.e., the message
		contents. This is why idempotency is required. If we PUT the same uniquely identified thing
		many times, we should still have one uniquely identified thing!
	</p>

	<h3>DELETE</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>... requests that the origin server delete the resource
   identified by the Request-URI ...</p>
		<footer><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.6" target="_blank">RFC 2616 HTTP/1.1</a>, section 9.7</footer>

<h2>PMT() Formula For Mortgage With Offset Account</h2>
<div>
	<p>
		Mortgage repayments are &quot;amortized&quot;, which means that the mortgage is 
		payed off with a fixed repayment schedule in regular installments over a period of time <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp" target="_blank">[Ref]</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Wikipedia has a good explanation for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest#Monthly_amortized_loan_or_mortgage_payments" target="_blank">
			formula used to calculate monthly amortized loan or mortgage payments</a>.
		The formula, however, does not apply to mortgages with an offset account.
	</p>
	<P>
		The following is based on the Wikipedia article. $F$ represents the balance of the offset account.
	</P>
	<p>
	TODO
	</p>

<h2>Fix FP</h2>
<div>
	<p>
		Fixed precision floating point we represent a floating-point number using $f$
		bits for the fractional component and $i$ bits for the integer component,
		to make an $N$ bit fixed floating-point number. So
		for example if we used 4 bits for the integer component and 4 bits for the
		fractional component we'd write:

		$$
			i_3 \  i_2 \  i_1 \  i_0 \cdot f_{-1} \  f_{-2} \  f_{-3} \  f_{-4}
		$$

		The &quot;dot&quot; is &quot;imaginary&quot; in the sense that we just represent this
		as a series of bits. To the computer it's just an integer but we are "prentending" it
		is a floating point number.

		The <b>unsigned</b> floating point number above has the value defined by the following, as far
		as we're concerned.

		$$
			i_3*2^3 + i_2*2^2  + i_1*2^1 + i_0*2^0 + f_{-1}*2^{-1} + f_{-2}*2^{-2} + f_{-3}*2^{-3} + f_{-4}*2^{-4}
		$$

		However, as far as the computer is concerned this is just an integer with the value,

		$$
			x_{i_3}*2^7 + x_{i_2}*2^6  + x_{i_1}*2^5 + x_{i_0}*2^4 + x_{f_{-1}}*2^3 + x_{f_{-2}}*2^2 + x_{f_{-3}}*2^1 + x_{f_{-4}}*2^0
		$$

		So, we get from the computer's idea of the value to our &quot;imagined&quot; decimal by dividing by $2^{4}$.
		More generally, if there are $f$ fractional bits, we are dividing by $2^{f}$.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus, to generically go from the computer's idea of an $N = i+f$ bit integer to our
		decimal value, we do this:

		$$
			U(i, f) = \frac{1}{2^f}\Sigma{n=0}{N-1}2^nx_n
		$$

		Note that this is for an <b>unsigned</b> type because the ${N-1}_{\text{th}}$ bit does not
		denote the sign of the value - the value is always +ve.
	</p>
	<p>
		So, what about negative numbers? Two's complement! To the computer a signed N bit integer
		will have the following value.

		$$
		\text{value} = -2^{N-1}x_{N-1} + \Sigma_{0}^{N-2} 2^nx_n
		$$

		This formula, describing how two's complement works also tells us why we often see two's complement shown
		as a circle. When the most significant bit is set we are at the most negative number. As we add 1
		we get less negative numbers until all bits are set and we have -1. Adding another 1 and we
		get zero (the addition overflows so the left-most bit which would have made us negative is lost)
		and so on...
	</p>
	<p>
		So, if we are using $f$ bits for the fractional component we do the following to get the fractinal value.

		$$
		S(i, f) = \frac{1}{2^f}\left(-2^{N-1}x_{N-1} + \Sigma_{0}^{N-2} 2^nx_n\right)
		$$
	</p>
	<p>
		Using the fact that we are just dividing by $2^f$ we can easily determine the ranges
		of $U(i, f)$ and $S(i, f)$.
	</p>
	<p>
		An unsigned number ranges from $0$ to $2^{N-1}$, so $U(i, f)$ must range from
		$0$ to $\frac{2^{N-1}}{2^f}$.
