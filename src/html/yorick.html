		<h2>Easy Yorick Install On Ubuntu</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Really very very easy. Just do <tt>sudo apt-get install yorick</tt>! If you want to develop
				your own Yorick plugins then your will also need to do a <tt>sudo apt-get install yorick-dev</tt>.
			</p>
			<pre>apt-get install yorick yorick-dbg yorick-dev</pre>
		</div>

		<h2>Get Yorick Home Path, Y_HOME</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				For some of my little make jobs I want to be able to compile Yorick on two targets.
				On one target it is built from scratch so Yorick lives in one directory but on my
				Linux box it lives under <tt>/usr/bin</tt> and <tt>/usr/lib</tt>. Really the <tt>/usr/bin/yorick</tt>
				binary just points to <tt>/usr/lib/yorick/bin/yorick</tt> as Yorick tends to live under the one
				installation directory.
			</p>
			<p>
				Usually to generate a plugin Makefile you'd just type...
			<pre>yorick -batch make.i</pre>
			<p>... and get an auto generated Makefile with variables pointing to your Yorick installation written into
				the Makefile for you. For example, on my Ubuntu atp-getted installation I get the following.
			</p>
			<pre># these values filled in by &quot;yorick -batch make.i&quot;
Y_MAKEDIR=/usr/lib/yorick
Y_EXE=/usr/lib/yorick/bin/yorick
Y_EXE_PKGS=
Y_EXE_HOME=/usr/lib/yorick
Y_EXE_SITE=/usr/lib/yorick
Y_HOME_PKG=</pre>
			<p>
				One way to get the Yorick installation directory for a system that is
				independent of the particular Yorick installation is as follows. 
			</p>
			<pre>YORICK_HOME="$(echo "print, Y_HOME" | yorick | grep '^".*yorick' | sed -e 's/"//g' | tr -d '\r' | sed -r 's/\/ *$//g')"
echo $YORICK_HOME</pre>
			<p>
				You can then substitute <tt>YORICK_HOME</tt> into the auto-generated Makefile so that
				it should work regardless who has the plugin and where their particular Yorick
				is installed (it might not be <tt>/usr/lib/yorick</tt> if they have installed in manually,
				for example).
			</p>
		</div>

		<h2>Yorick Arrays</h2>
		<div>
			<h3>Versus C Arrays</h3>
			<p>The major differences are</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Yorick arrays start at index <tt>1</tt> but C arrays start at index <tt>0</tt>.
				<li>Yorick arrays are column-major whereas C arrays are row-major. This means that <tt>array[1][2]</tt> in C addresses row 1, 
				column 2, but in Yorick (adjust syntax to <tt>array(1,2)</tt>) it addresses column 1, row 2 (in C column 0, row 1 taking 
				into account the start index of <tt>1</tt> instead of <tt>0</tt>.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Row/Column Major</h4>
			<p>
				For all languages, arrays are are contigous blocks of items. Therefore, in memory we can 
				store a 1D arrays as follows:
			</p>
			<pre>| ITEM[0] | ITEM[1] | ITEM[2] |  ...  | ITEM[N]
|         |         |         |       |
0 *sz     |         |         |       |
          1 *sz     |         |       |
                    2 *sz     |       |
                              3 * sz  :
                                      |
                                      N * sz</pre>
			<p>
				Here we store the first array element at the lowest memory address and increment upwards. 
				You can see that each element is contiguous in memory.
			</p><p>
				What happens when we try to store a 2D array? Consider the following array:
			</p><pre>int someArray[2][3] = { { 1, 2, 3},
                        { 4, 5, 6} }</pre>
			<p>
				This is something we're very used to in C. We read this as an array with 2 rows and 3 columns.
				But how is this laid out in memory? It still has to be a contiguous chunk of memory but now there
				are two layout options. The C way is to lay out the array as follows:
			</p><pre>
| ITEM[0][0] | ITEM[0][1] | ITEM[0][2] | ITEM[1][0] | ITEM[1][1] | ...
|            |            |            |     ^^^    |          
0 *sz        |            |            | Note: new  |
             1 *sz        |            | row starts |
                          2 *sz        |            |
                                       3* sz        |
                                                    |
                                                    4 * sz</pre>
			<p>
				The array items are represented as a contiguous flow of values. The first row is laid out as it
				was for the 1D array, then the second row is appended to this block as if it were a 1D array
				and so on. Each row, therefore, starts at address <tt>row_index*3</tt>.
			</p><p>
				The C syntax specifies the fastest increasing index in memory from right to left. We can see 
				this in the above definition, <tt>int [2][3]</tt>, where the left most dimension is <tt>3</tt> 
				and represents the fastest increasing dimension in memory. The way to think about this is considering
				an <tt>int p* = someArray</tt> pointer. As we increment this pointer by one (<tt>p++</tt>) it will traverse the columns in a row,
				which is what Munro calls the fastest increasing dimension, and then once all the columns in one row
				are iterated over it will move to the columns in the next row and so on.
			</p><p>
				The next dimension to the right in <tt>int [2][3]</tt>, <tt>2</tt> is the second most fast increasing because as
				we increase our pointer <tt>p</tt> we will go through the rows.
			</p><p>
				This method of thinking about an array can be used for any number of dimensions. Consider <tt>int anotherArray[2][3][4][5]</tt>.
				We know that the fasted increasing dimension is <tt>5</tt>, so if <tt>int *p = anotherArray</tt> then...
			</p>
			<ul><li><tt>*p &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;== anotherArray[0][0][0][0]</tt></li>
				 <li><tt>*(p+<b>1</b>) == anotherArray[0][0][0][<u>1</u>]</tt></li>
				 <li><tt>...</tt></li>
				 <li><tt>*(p+<b>4</b>) == anotherArray[0][0][0][<u>4</u>]</tt></li>
			</ul>
			</p><p>
				We also know that:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><tt>*(p+<b>a*5</b>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; == anotherArray[0][0][<u>a</u>][0]</tt></li>
				<li><tt>*(p+<b>b*4*5</b>) &nbsp; == anotherArray[0][<u>b</u>][0][0]</tt></li>
				<li><tt>*(p+<b>c*3*4*5</b>) == anotherArray[<u>c</u>][0][0][0]</tt></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				So when we say <em>row-major</em>, we mean that, in terms of the syntax, the right most index is the
				<em>fastest incrementing dimension</em> and going left the speed of increment decreases.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Column-major</em> therefore means, that, again in terms of the syntax, the right most index is the
				<em>slowest incrementing dimensions</em> and going left the speed of increment increases.
			</p><p>
				I keep saying &quot;in terms of syntax&quot; because as Yorick is implemented in C its physical array
				storage is C-like. It is only in the scripting language itself that column-major notation is used.
			</p>
	
			<h4>In C</h4>
			<p>Consider the following C program:</p>
			<pre>#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {           +-+-+-&gt; along the right most [] (depth)
                           | | |
   int b[2][2][3] = { +&gt;{ {1,2,3}, &lt;+| 
                      |   {4,5,6}  &lt;+| second most [col]
                      | },
                      +&gt;{ {11,22,33},
                      |   {44,55,66}  
                      | } };
                      +- outer most (row)

	int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
	for(i = 0; i &lt; 2; ++i ) 
		for(j = 0; j &lt; 2; ++j) for(k = 0; k &lt; 3; ++k)
			printf("b[%i][%i][%i] == %i\n", i, j, k, b[i][j][k]);</pre>
			<p>
				It outputs the following...
			</p>
			<pre>b[0][0][0] == 1	b[1][0][0] == 11
b[0][0][1] == 2	b[1][0][1] == 22
b[0][0][2] == 3	b[1][0][2] == 33
b[0][1][0] == 4	b[1][1][0] == 44
b[0][1][1] == 5	b[1][1][1] == 55
b[0][1][2] == 6	b[1][1][2] == 66</pre>

			<p>
				Have to visualise the inner brace as being your <em>least</em> dimension. So 
				in the 3D case the inner brace gives you the 3rd, axis, depth or really z. The next
				outer brace gives you the next least axis, in this case column. So you are getting 
				columns of the inner axis. Scale up then to rows. The cube therefore looks like:
			</p>
			<pre>
           3------6
          /      /| 
         2------5 |
        /  33--/--66           [r][c][d]
       1------4  /             Its basically a matter of definition of
 |     | 22---|-55   _ d       what row,col,depth means in terms of
 |     |/     |/     /|        the C array layout. Must structure numbers
 |     11     44    /          in array appropriately if we defined [r][c][d]
 \/                /           as opposed to say, [d][r][c] or any
 r -------------&gt; c            other combination
		</pre>
			<p>
				Basically in C world we work from the outer brace inwards so the right-most index is 
				our least significant dimension and the left-most index is our most significant dimension 
				(in this case row)

"b[3][2][1] == 6"  r -------------&gt; c            other combination
"b[3][2][2] == 66"  
</pre>
			<p>
				Basically in Yorick world we work from the inner brace outwards so the left-most 
				index is our least significant dimension and the right-most index is our most significant 
				dimension (in this case row)
			</p>


			<h3>Slices Are Not Like NumPy Slices</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					In NumPy slices are like views into the array, but this
					is <em>not</em> the case in Yorick. If we transliterate the 
					<a href="python/numpy.html#numpy_slice">NumPy example</a> into Yorick 
					script, we will see a different result! See below:
				</p>
				<pre>&gt; a = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
&gt; b = a(2:4)
&gt; b
[2,3,4]
&gt; b(:) = 111
&gt; b
[111,111,111]
&gt; a /*&lt;-- LOOK: Unlike the NumPy example, a has not been affected! */
[1,2,3,4,5,6]</pre>
			</div>

			<h3>Arrays Passed To Functions By Reference</h3>
			<p>
				Arrays are passed to functions by reference in the sense that if you modify the array in
				the function, the caller's array is modified...
			</p>
			<pre>&gt; y = [1,2,3,4]
&gt; func cheeseit(x) {
    x(1) = 9999 /*&lt;-- NOTE: Will change array in caller's scope */
  }
&gt; cheeseit(y)
&gt; y /*&lt;-- NOTE: y has been changed by function */
[9999,2,3,4]</pre>
			<p>
				For a pass-by-copy kind of semantic, do the following, but note copying an array will
				be expensive if this is a large array!
			</p>
			<pre>&gt; y = [1,2,3,4]
&gt; func cheeseit(x) {
    x_local = x       /*&lt;-- x is <em>copied</em> to x_local, but copy is <em>EXPENSIVE</em>! */
    x_local(1) = 9999 /*&lt;-- Changes to x_local will NOT affect array in caller's scope */
&gt; cheeseit(y)
&gt; y /*&lt;-- NOTE: y is NOT changed by the function */
[1,2,3,4]</pre>

            ## outer array

&gt; a(1,:)    ## Give me the first element in each inner array, contained in the
[1,4]       ## same parent array. This is a little incorrect because we don’t
            ## specify all array dimensions in the indecies

&gt; a(1,:,:)      ## Give me the first element in each inner array, from each 
[[1,4],[11,44]] ## outer array, contained in the overall array

&gt; a(1,..)       ## The RUBBER INDEX says the same thing: Give me the first
[[1,4],[11,44]] ## element from the innermost array and do the same recursing
                ## outwards

&gt; a(1,*)        ## Another RUBBER INDEX that collapses all arrays into one.
[1,4,11,44]

&gt; a(:,1,1)      ## Give me everything from the first array, i.e., the array
[1,2,3]         ## itself, from the element in the middle array from the first
                ## element in the outer array.

&gt; a(:,1,..)           ## Give me everything from the first array, ie. the
[[1,2,3],[11,22,33]]  ## array itself, from the first element in the middle

	<h2>Oxy Objects</h2>
	<h3>Copying Oxy Objects</h3>
	<p>
		When you assigned an OXY object from one variable to another is is <em>copied by reference</em>.
		Thus changing an object member will be reflected in both variables as <em>assignment is not copy</em>
		for OXY objects.
	</p>

	<div>
		<pre>&gt; a = save(q = 123)
&gt; a.q
123
&gt; b = a
&gt; save, a, q=321 /*&lt;--  Changing a's member variable will change b's! */
&gt; a.q 
321
&gt; b.q 
321              /*&lt;-- LOOK, b has been affected by the change to a! */</pre>
	</div>

	<p>
		Given the rational behind Yorick as a number cruncher, this makes a lot of sense. It's a little like passing an array into
		a function. If we think as an OXY object as a potential &quot;bag&quot; of large data, copying it would be hugely expensive, so that is why an object
		assignment is NOT a copy!
	</p>
	<p>
		To actually make a realy copy of the object you have to manually copy each member of one object to the other.
	</p>
	<pre>&gt; a = save(q=101)
&gt; b = save()     /*&lt;-- Must manually re-create a new... */
&gt; save, b, q=a.q /*    ...object if we are to copy a */
&gt; a
object [1]: group
&gt; a.q
101
&gt; b.q
101
&gt; save, a, q=999
&gt; a.q
999
&gt; b.q
101              /*&lt;-- Changing a.q has not affected b.q. We did a proper copy!</pre>
	<p>
		BUT, this is further complicated by arrays as member variables and OXY objects as
		member variables. For example, examine the following.
	</p>
	<pre>&gt; a = save(q=[1,2,3])        
&gt; b = save()
&gt; save, b, q=a.q
&gt; b.q
[1,2,3]
&gt; a.q
[1,2,3]
&gt; a.q(1) = 111
&gt; a.q
[111,2,3]
&gt; b.q
[111,2,3]</pre>
	<p>
		In the above example we used the same recipe as above, but because <tt>q</tt> is now an array
		the reference to the array is copied and not the value. Again, make sense for Yorick as a
		number cruncher of large data arrays, but if you wanted a copy, this could throw you. The same
		copy-of-reference problem would occur if <tt>q</tt> has been another OXY object.
	</p>
	<p>
		To fully, deep copy, an OXY object your therefore have to build a new object from scratch,
		and copy in all primative types and then recursively copy in all member OXY objects and also
		take care to copy the arrays correctly.
	</p>
