	<h2>Scope In JavaScript</h2>
	<div>
		<p>Scope is the context in which code is executed, and there are three types in JavaScript.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>global scope,</li>
			<li>local scope (aka &quot;function scope&quot;),</li>
			<li>eval scope.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			If you come from a C-ish background you may notice a pretty big 
			ommission in the above list... there is no block scope!

			<div class="box_container"><div class="info">
				<p>
					JavaScript does not have block scope. Any variables declared in a
					block, i.e, <tt>{ ... var xxx; ...}</tt> are local to the
					function in which they are declared or, worse, the global scope.
				</p>
			</div></div>
		</p>
		<p>
			One thing that really got me was the use of <tt>var</tt>, or more
			precisely, what happens when you do not use <tt>var</tt> to declare
			local variables. If you do not declare a variable using <tt>var</tt>
			in a function it actually gets created in the global scope! One to 
			watch out for.

			<div class="box_container"><div class="warning">
				<p>
					Variables declared in a function that do NOT use <tt>var</tt> in
					the declaration are created in the global scope and not the 
					function/local scope as you might expect.
				</p>
			</div></div>
		</p>
		<p>
			To resolve a symbol, JavaScript goes down the scope chain: first look
			up symbol in the function/local scope, then in the parent scope, the
			grandparent scope, and so on, until the global scope is reached. The
			first symbol found is used. This is why closures work...
		</p>
	</div> <!-- END H2 div -->

	<h2>Closures In JavaScript</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			Closures work due to the scope chain that was described above.
			From parent function return a reference to the child function
			contained within it. When this child function (nested function) is 
			invoked, it still has access to the parent function's scope because of
			the scope chain. See Richard Cornford's 
			article  
			<a href="http://jibbering.com/faq/notes/closures/" target="_blank">[3]</a> 
			for further info.

	<h2>Objects In JavaScript</h2>
	<div>
		<pre>
OBJECTS:
--------

Primatives are stored in the variable
Reference types are just pointers to memory locations

Eg primatives in variable
	var c1 = "red";
	var c2 = c1;
	c1 = "orance";

	// c1 is "orange"
	// c2 is still "red"

Eg Reference type is pointer
	var o1 = new Object();
	var o2 = o1
	
	o1.newAttr = "J" //&lt; Note: can add property at any time
	// o2.newAttr == "J"


Builtin Types
Array
Data
Object
Error
Function
RefExp

Object literal --&gt; var o1 = { 'prop1': "something", "prop2" : 101 }
                          = { prop1: "something",    prop2 : 101 } // Dont need quotes

Equiv to
var o1 = new Object;
o1.prop1 = "something"
o1.prop2 = 101



Array literal --&gt; var a1 = [1,2]

Equiv to var a1 = Array(1,2)

function declarations vs expressions:
	function add(n1, n2) { return n1 + n2} is a declaration
	var add = function(n1,n2) { return n1 + n2} is an expression

	declarations are HOISTED to the top of the context so it can be defined after its use!
	this is NOT the case for expressions!

function parameters:
	can be any number passed in
	funcion.length is #args func expects
	access arbirary arguments using arguments[] array
	functions can't be overloaded as lack of solid parameters list means lack of signature


object methods
	methods are just properties that reference functions

	var cat = {
		name: "kitty",
		speak: function() { console.log(this.name + " says meow"); }
	}

	Every scope in JavaScript has a this object that represents the calling
	object for the function. In the global scope, this represents the
	global object (window in web browsers). When a function is called while
	attached to an object, the value of this is equal to that object by default.

	The value of this, is based on the context in which the function
	is called at **RUN TIME**

	function sayNameForAll() {
		console.log(this.name);
	}
	
	var person1 = {
		name: "Nicholas",
		sayName: sayNameForAll
	};
	var person2 = {
		name: "Greg",
		sayName: sayNameForAll
	};
	var name = "Michael";
	person1.sayName(); // outputs "Nicholas"
	person2.sayName(); // outputs "Greg"
	sayNameForAll(); // outputs "Michael"


	CHANGING THIS:
		Call()
		Call() function with parameters but bind this to some specific context rather than the auto-assigned one
		function sayNameForAll(label) {
			console.log(label + ":" + this.name);
		}
		var person1 = {
			name: "Nicholas"
		};
		var person2 = {
			name: "Greg"
		};
		var name = "Michael";
		sayNameForAll.call(this, "global"); // outputs "global:Michael"
		sayNameForAll.call(person1, "person1"); // outputs "person1:Nicholas"
		sayNameForAll.call(person2, "person2"); // outputs "person2:Greg"

		Apply()
		apply() function. Like call except parameters are in array

		Bind()
		Creates a new function from the "template" with any parameters (minimum is this)
		permanently bound.
		var sayNameForPerson2 = sayNameForAll.bind(person2, "person2");
		sayNameForPerson2(); // outputs "person2:Greg"

Test For Object Properties
	property_name in object_name
		Does not evaluate the property just says if present
		Checks for bowth own and prototype properties
	obj.hasOwnProperty() to check for specifically own properties

Remove property
	delete obj.property_name
	NOTE: This only works on own properties

Enumerate properties:
	for(property in object) {...} or
	var props = Object.keys(object); for(var i=0; i &lt; props.length; ++i) { ... }
	The for-in loop also enumerates prototype properties, while Object.keys() returns only own (instance) properties

Constructor:
	A constructor is simply a function that is used with new to create an object. 

	Constructors allow you to initialize an instance of a type in a consistent
	way, performing all of the property setup that is necessary before the object can be used.

	Make sure to always call constructors with new; otherwise, you risk
	changing the global object instead of the newly created object.

	Function name with capital is convention to represent object

	Eg

		var cat = {
			name: "kitty",
			speak: function() { console.log(this.name + " says meow"); }
		}

	Translates into

	function Cat(name) {
		this.name = name;
		this.speak = function() { 
			console.log(this.name + " says meow"); 
		};
	}

	
Prototype:
	A recipe for a object.
	The shared nature of prototypes makes them ideal for defining methods
	once for all objects of a given type. Itâ€™s much more efficient to put 
	the methods on the prototype and then use this to access the current instance.

	function Person(name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
	Person.prototype.sayName = function() {
		console.log(this.name);
	};

	Or on mass
	
	Person.prototype = {
		constructor: NAME, // Using the object literal notation to overwrite the prototype changed
					the constructor property so that it now points to Object u instead of Person.
					This happened because the constructor property exists on the prototype,
					not on the object instance. When a function is created, its prototype property
					is created with a constructor
					property equal to the function.
		sayName: function() { ... },
		...
	}

	Checking for properties in the prototype...

	function hasPrototypeProperty(object, name) {
		return name in object && !object.hasOwnProperty(name);
	}

	Each instance has pointer back to prototype through internal property [[Prototype]]
	You can read the value of the [[Prototype]] property by using the Object.getPrototypeOf()
	method on an object: 
		var prototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(object);


	You can also test to see if one object is a prototype for another by
	using the isPrototypeOf()
		var object = {};
		console.log(Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(object));



	You can also store other types of data on the prototype, but be careful
	when using reference values. Because these values are shared across
	instances, you might not expect one instance to be able to change values
	that another instance will access.


	


Inheritance - Prototype Chaining:

	Prototype is also an object, it has its own prototype and inherits properties
	from that. This is the prototype chain: An object inherits from its prototype,
	while that prototype in turn inherits from its prototype, and so on.
		
	Methods inherited from Object:
	valueOf() - lets you do +/-/&lt;gt; etc operations by returning value
	toString() - Called if valueOf() returns reference instead of primative. Also when JS expects string.
	propertyIsEnumerable()
	hasOwnProperty()
	ifPrototypeOf()

	Object.prototype - DONT CHANGE: All objects inherit from Object.prototype by 
	default, so changes to Object.prototype affect all objects.

	Simple Inheritance
		Explicitly specify [[Prototype]] with the Object.create(obj-for-proto, [prop-descr]) method:
		
		var book = {
			title: "The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript"
		};
		// is the same as
		var book = Object.create(Object.prototype, {
			title: {
				configurable: true,
				enumerable: true,
				value: "The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript",
				writable: true
			}
		});

		Or do MyObject.prototype = new OtherObject();
		MyObject.prototype.constructor = MyObject;

		Or MyObject.prototype = Object.create(OtherObject.prototype, {
			constructor: {
				value: MyObject;
			}});
	
		Always make sure that you overwrite the prototype before adding properties to it,
		or you will lose the added methods when the overwrite happens.



	Calling SuperClass Constructor:
		function Rectangle(length, width) {
			this.length = length;
			this.width = width;
		}
		Rectangle.prototype.getArea = function() {
			return this.length * this.width;
		};
		Rectangle.prototype.toString = function() {
			return "[Rectangle " + this.length + "x" + this.width + "]";
		};
		// inherits from Rectangle
		function Square(size) {
			Rectangle.call(this, size, size);
			// optional: add new properties or override existing ones here
		}
		Square.prototype = Object.create(Rectangle.prototype, {
			constructor: {
				configurable: true,
				enumerable: true,
				value: Square,
				writable: true
			}
		});


	Call supertype method:
		// call the supertype method
		Square.prototype.toString = function() {
			var text = Rectangle.prototype.toString.call(this);
			return text.replace("Rectangle", "Square");
		};

Module Pattern:
	The module pattern is an object-creation pattern designed to create singleton
	objects with private data. The basic approach is to use an immediately
	invoked function expression (IIFE) that returns an object. An IIFE is a function
	expression that is defined and then called immediately to produce a
	result. That function expression can contain any number of local variables
	that arenâ€™t accessible from outside that function. Because the returned
	object is defined within that function, the objectâ€™s methods have access
	to the data.

	var yourObject = (function() {
		// private data variables
		return {
			// public methods and properties
		};
	}());

Scope safe constructors:
	function Person(name) {
		if (this instanceof Person) {
			// called with "new"
			this.name = name;
		} else {
			// called without "new"
			return new Person(name);
		}
	}
