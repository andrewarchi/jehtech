		<h2>Widgets, Interact And MPLD3</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Wow, some of the Python stuff available is just immense. This is an example of using
				the IPython HTML widgets, interact, and <a href="http://mpld3.github.io/" target="_blank">MPLD3</a>
				to display on demand different a particular graph which can be panned and zoomed! The example code
				might not be the best... I'm still learning this, but I'm just wowed at how easy Python and its
				surrounding support libraries makes doing this sort if thing! 
			</p>

			<p>
				It's worth noting that the Python distro I had, had a slightly out of date IPython so I needed to do
				a <tt>pip install --upgrade ipython</tt> to update everything to take advantage of the latest widget
				library.
			</p>
			<p>
				On my Ubuntu machine, at the time of writing, I also had to upgrade various things, including matplotlib for MPLD3 from version 1.1.0 to 1.3.0:
			</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-bash">sudo pip install --upgrade ipython
sudo pip install --upgrade pyzmq
sudo pip install --upgrade tornado
sudo pip install jsonschema
sudo easy_install -U distribute
sudo pip install --upgrade matplotlib</pre>
			<p>
				So... a quick example using MPLD3 and widgets...
			</p>

			<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-python">
import numpy as np
from IPython.html import widgets
from IPython import display
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, mpld3
%matplotlib inline # Make sure matplotlib graphs are displayed inline in cell HTML output

graphChoice = widgets.Select(options=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
plotBtn     = widgets.Button(description="Plot")

def PlotIt(btn):
    display.clear_output()    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    x = np.linspace(-10,10,25)
    if graphChoice.value == 'a': y = np.power(x, 2)
    if graphChoice.value == 'b': y = np.power(x, 3)
    if graphChoice.value == 'c': y = -np.power(x, 2)
    if graphChoice.value == 'd': y = -np.power(x, 3)
    ax.plot(x,y, marker='x')
    mpld3Fig = mpld3.display(fig) # Auto removes `fig` for us
    display.display(mpld3Fig)

plotBtn.on_click(PlotIt)
display.display(graphChoice)
display.display(plotBtn)
			</pre>

			<p>
			You can <a target="_blank" href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/www.jeh-tech.com/html/downloadables/notebooks/mpld3_example.ipynb">see this in action</a> 
			using the online nbviewer... Hover over the graph with your mouse cursor. At the bottom left some grey icons will pop-up. Click on the pan icon and then
			you can pan through the graph by draging it and zoom using the mouse scroll wheel... all real time and interactive in your browser window.
			</p>
			<p>
			One slightly annoying thing is that the notebook viewer doesn't display the interactive widgets so although you can see the
			mpld3 interactive graph in action, you can't see the widgets in action which would allow you to select what graph you want to see.
			Download the notebook and run locally for that part of the demo.

		<h2>CSS For Notebook Output HTML</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				I wanted to format the output HTML style of HTML generated in NB cells but without effecting the formatting
				of the NB itself... just the output of cells!
			</p>
			<p>
				Credits to the following two SO threads...
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20124877/css-styling-of-html-in-ipython-notebook-output"
					    target="_blank">CSS Styling Of HTML In Ipython Notebook Output</a>
				</li>
				<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18024769/adding-custom-styled-paragraphs-in-markdown-cells"
					    target="_blank">Adding Custome Styled Paragraphs In Markdown Cells</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The last thread discusses being able to put the CSS styling in a markdown cell as one of the
				solutions. However, this didn't work for me. I found it worked by displaying the HTML element
				that contained the <tt>style</tt> tag...
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/www.jeh-tech.com/html/downloadables/output_css_1.ipynb"
					target="_blank">Ouput_css_1.ipynb</a> demonstrates the first situation where I have output a CSS
				stylesheet for the output HTML from the NB cells, but although most of the new CSS properties I set
				are obeyed, `vertical-align` for a table cell is not. That was annoying...
			</p>
			<p><a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/www.jeh-tech.com/html/downloadables/output_css_2.ipynb"
					target="_blank">Ouput_css_2.ipynb</a> demonstrates a first attempt to fix the above problem.
				By making the CSS properties that were previously not obeyed <tt>!important</tt> they are then
				implemented. The disadvantage here is that I have to smatter my style sheet with <tt>!important</tt>
				tags rather than using the cascading and inheritance properties of CSS. Seems cludgey to me...
			</p>
			<p><a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/www.jeh-tech.com/html/downloadables/output_css_3.ipynb"
					target="_blank">Ouput_css_3.ipynb</a> tries a different approach. The output from the NB cells
				are all placed in DIVs with a class <tt>.output_html</tt>. The NB style sheet includes CSS
				definitions for children of nodes with the <tt>.output_html</tt> class and it is these that are
				overriding the settings I want to make. The approach here is to define styles for elements that
				are the children of <tt>.output_html</tt> nodes...
