<h3>Linux without the SE</h3>
<p>
  The Linux kernel controls that access that a process has to resources. In the standard Linux
  <u>D</u>iscrtionary <u>A</u>ccess <u>C</u>ontroll (DAC) this is does by assigning users and
  resources to groups. Processes are given the same group and user IDs as the user that started
  the process. The process can then access a resource if it shares either the same user or group ID
  with the resource, or if the resource is &quot;public&quot;.
</p>
<p>
  I.e., a process accesses a resource based on the resource access bits:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>If the resource available to anyone, the the process can access it,</li>
  <li>Otherwise if the process and resource are in the same group then the the process can access it,</li>
  <li>Otherwies if the process and resource are owned by the same user, the process can access it,</li>
  <li>Otherwise the process cannot access the resource.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  This is called a security <em>policy</em>. The policy is the set of rules used to make access
  control decisions.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, access to system resources must be set by the system admin, who will decide which
  users belong to which groups and which system resources belong to which group (and user). However,
  the system is <em>discretionary</em> <q>in the sense that a subject with a certain access permission is capable of passing that permission (perhaps indirectly) on to any other subject</q> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_access_control" target="_blank">[Ref]</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This discretionary access means that the system admin is not totally in control of who accesses
  what. For example, Bob can change the group associated with a file he owns and suddenly
  give a different set of indiviudals the right to read/write/execute that file. This is not
  in the system admin's control. Bob has been able to make to make a <em>policy decision</em>!
</p>
<p>
  The main RedHat article referenced <a href="http://people.redhat.com/dwalsh/SELinux/Presentations/ManageRHEL5.pdf" target="_blank">[Ref]</a>,
  describes some of the disadvantages in more detail. In summary they are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Processes' access is based on users' access: the kernel can not distinguish applications from users,</li>
  <li>Processes can change security properties: discretionary access control. Processes can escape security policy!</li>
  <li>Only 2 privilege levels, user and root: too simplistic and no way to enforce &quot;least-privilege&quot; (i.e., a process should be given
      only those priviliges essential for it to perform its work) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege", target="_blank">[Ref]</a></li>

<h3>SELinux: A Bird's Eye View</h3>
<p>
  SELinux stands for <u>S</u>ecurity <u>E</u>nhanced Linux. It is built on years of the NSA's
  security research and is an applicaton of their Flash security architecture, implemented as part of the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Security_Modules" target="_blank">Linux Security Module (LSM)</a>
  framework. It adds <em><u>M</u>anditory <u>A</u>ccess <u>C</u>ontroll (MAC)</em> to Linux:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    ...With mandatory access control, this security policy is <em>centrally controlled</em> by a security policy administrator; users do not have the ability to override the policy ... By contrast, discretionary access control ... allows users the ability to make policy decisions and/or assign security attributes. ... MAC-enabled systems allow policy administrators to implement organization-wide security policies. Under MAC (and unlike DAC), users cannot override or modify this policy, either accidentally or intentionally ... in principle ...

<p>
  Most intestestingly, for me at least, Android uses SELinux (since 4.3)
  <a href="https://source.android.com/security/selinux/concepts" target="_blank">[Ref]</a>
  which means that it is
  a very heavily used and &quot;industry-leading&quot; security measure. If you're going to work in the guts of
  Android, a little knowledge of SELinux goes a long way... hence why I'm trying to learn a little
  about it.
</p>
<p>
  So, a more secure Linux: access control is mandatory (default denial - anythong not explicilty allowed is denied), more fine grained (no longer just root and not-root) and also implements the principle of least-privilege.
</p>
<p>
  There are thee forms of access control, the only one I've made notes on is <em><u>T</u>ype <u>E</u>nforcement</em> (TE),
  which is the primary SELinux mechanism.
</p>
<p>
  The basic, 30k foot view of SELinux operation is this...
  Whenever a process accesses a file (this could be disk-based, a socket or shared memory, for example)
  or some other resource, this is intercepted in the kernel by SELinux. It will check all of the
  rules in the security policy and if the rules allow it access is granted, otherwise it is denied.
  The same is true when a user attempts to start a process. This is shown below:
</p>

<h3>Security Contents</h3>
<p>
  All processes and files have a <em>security context</em>. A security context defines the security settings
  applied to a subject (user, resource etc). I guess the entire set of security contexts applied to everything
  ina system constitutes the security policy.
</p>
<p>
  The SELinux <em>security context</em> is applied via a label associated with every user, process and resource.
  To put it another way, we can say that the rights of a process depend on it's security context. A security
  context is defined as follows:
</p>
<pre>user:role:type:level</pre>
<p>
  The field <code>type</code> is used for type enforcement (TE), the role and level fields I will
  ignore.
</p>
<p>
  Access is only allowed between types via the security policy and every process and resources
  used by that processes must have a security context (remember denial by default).
</p>
<p>
  A &quot;<em>domain</em>&quot; is a little bit of jargon you'll hear a lot:
  The security context associated with a process is called the processes' <em>domain</em>.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    When a type is associated with a process, it defines what processes
    (or domains) the SELinux user (the subject) can access.
  </p><p>
    When a type is associated with an object, it defines what access
    permissions the SELinux user has to that object.
